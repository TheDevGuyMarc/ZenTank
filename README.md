# Aquazen ZenTank

ZenTank is a tank computer that helps control all types of tanks that one could have. This helps with automation of many tasks in this hobby and also with scheduling certain tasks perfectly. In addition to that you can also improve on measuring and tracking of values.

ZenTank is not only software but also a HAT board for the Raspberry Pi. We support all Raspberry Pi's with a 40 Pin GPIO.

## Tech Stack

See the README files in the specific project folders please.

## Tests

With ZenTank we test each module before release, that means we do unit and integration tests (automated) before new features reach the customer. What do we test how ?

**Unit Tests**:

- Backend Repository
- Backend Service
- Frontend Service

**Integration Tests**:

- Backend Controller
- Frontend Components

**Performance Tests:**

- All

**Vulnerability Tests:**

- All

### Run Tests

```bash
  npm run test:unit
  npm run test:integration
```

## Deployment

Because you need to deploy ZenTank to a Raspberry Pi there is a need to prepare the Pi and then move the code to that chip.

For that we prepared an automated way to deploy.

```bash

```
