### Hardware Planning

#### Technical Decisions

As base we want to use the any Raspberry Pi or other SBC that has 40 Pins as GPIO and has the same mapping as the Raspberry Pi 4. In Addition to that one could add their own mapping via creating a device in ZenTank as long as it doesn't deviate from some fixed GPIO pins like I2C or others.

Because the GPIO pins are somewhat limited in a sense that there are only certain amount of pins for I2C, UART and PWM we use some additional boards that might or might not be integrated later in the final ZenTank Pi HAT. If you want to see the additional boards we have chosen for now look in the [components](#components) section, there you can also find the pin outs needed for those boards and components. The question if we integrate those external boards as internal circuits is currently not clear because this is mainly a viability question in terms of: "Why reinventing the wheel if there is a component that is tested and working out there and we can just add it as addition to the board?".

If you want to see how we wired up certain components you can look this up in our [wiring](#wiring) section below.

## Data Structure

## Architecture Overview

The whole project is developed in a Domain Driven Design (DDD) which allows us to better modularize code packets that really belong together. Besides that we are using a REST API architecture with a changeable UI, meaning that we deliver our data via the REST protocol in a stateless fashion and the UI can be changed by the user. We certainly provide a react UI but if the user might want to use something else or customize his UI he can certainly do so, so we are kinda in the headless realm here also. If you look at the file structure you will notice that the API and the UI are looking pretty much identical with some minor deviations, that is because we are mirroring the structure of the API to the UI.

## Version Control

Because we are writing code here, version control is super important. We are using Git because we are familiar with it and our repository is hosted on GitHub. In addition to that we are using Git-flow as branching method, which allows us to differentiate between code features.
